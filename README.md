# Backbone Formbuider

Backbone Formbuilder is a side-project and a work in progress.

Backbone Formbuilder is an attempt at building a non trivial backbone app. I've decided
not to use any 3rd party plugins because i want to encounter the problems that these plugins
are trying to solve in the first place. I believe that adding another level of 
abstraction/complexity that solves a problem i don't yet understand is silly. 

Used libraries and frameworks: 

* Underscore(amd version)
* Backbone(amd version)
* Bower (package manager)
* jQueryUI(amd version)
* require.js

Things i want to solve with this app: 

* Nested models and collections
* Nested views, subviews and collection views
* Item views, Collection Views and Composite views
* Best practises for jQueryUI driven Backbone views

The progress will be documented at [http://rusln.github.io/](http://rusln.github.io/)
